Unfortunately the mozzies were a bother in the only bedroom without nets but this was overcome with extra spray.  And parking is a bother but that is how it is in Bondi.

Two bathrooms felt like luxury (as did the king size bed), and the flat was super convenient to great restaurants (Mamasan and Avila were both tasty in their own ways, and right around the corner) and the beach. Shopping and tasty gelato (our kids were staunch advocates for the Messina Gelato) were only a slight stone's throw further away on Hall St. \\r\\n\\r\\nHaving coffee available in the morning was a particular treat (thank you again, Cat), and there were ample cookbooks to review if we had had the time to really use the kitchen. Communications with Cat were easy for checking in and out; we didn't need to trouble her during our visit because the replacement light bulbs were easy to find when one fixture burnt out. We would definitely consider staying here again. \"},\n",

As a bunch of aged birdwatchers we didn't really fit in but felt comfortable and accepted anyway. Lots of shops and good restaurants within easy walking distance, and the beach is just as close. There's even a funky little nine hole golf course close by. It's perched on a cliff that overlooks the ocean and has million dollar views.\\n\\nThe house worked well for five adults (one couple and three others) and was clean and well appointed. There are even cookbooks displayed in the kitchen in case you wanted to get adventurous. One of the bedrooms is in a guesthouse in the back yard and it was a nice place for the couple to sleep and be apart form the others. Be prepared for visiting bugs, though.\\n\\nBelieve Cat when she says that you won't be able to park inside the gate without a high clearance vehicle but you will be able to park in the driveway if your car is on the small side. We had a minivan that was simply too big to allow for pedestrians pushing baby strollers to get by. Parking on the street is for two hours only and the nearest long-term free parking is s few blocks away. Remember to always leave space between you and the next car as locals seem to have no issue with pinning you in if you don't. \\n\\nCat was great about communicating with us. She seemed available at all times, promptly answering any questions that we had.\\n\\nEric\\nVancouver, WA \\nUSA\"},\n",

The space is large and the main house shower was spectacular. The bedrooms and living space are large. The small touches were nice - there was coffee available which was huge, and the hair dryer available worked really well (long haired Airbnbers know how important this is)! \\n\\nCat was an amazing host, and was extremely responsive. The outdoor spade was lovely and the fish are a great touch. As someone who isn’t used to seeing bugs often, the amount of bugs we saw was a bit alarming, but Cat took care of this right away!'},\n",

Cat's place is a private oasis in  the heart of beach-chic Bondi, only three quaint blocks to the sand (which my four-year-old insisted on completing barefoot like the locals).  It's as hip as Brooklyn but with better weather than Los Angeles and a fraction of the people,  Everything you could want is in the kitchen, and many thoughtful extras in the bathroom.  We enjoyed reading on the front porch and dining al fresco in the garden. Cat was a responsive super helpful hostess with a nice vibe in keeping with the Bondi lifestyle.

Very friendly, great communication and really thoughtful, unexpectedly offering us early check in and late check out because it was possible. \\n\\nThe house has a lovely friendly feel to it, and is as amazing as the pictures look, they are accurate.   Loved sitting in the beautiful courtyard, sipping champagne and enjoying the fish.\\n\\nSo many small attentions to detail.... having champagne stoppers, insect repellant and a really helpful guide to the house and how to navigate the surrounding areas. Lovely toiletries and an amazing open fire - yes I had the fire going, not because it was really cold, but because I love an open fire and this was one of the reasons I chose the property.  Cat was very accommodating with this and we had plenty of firewood. The fire burnt and drew well.\\n\\nGreat location. The house is a very easy walk to Bondi Beach, even for unfit me, and an even shorter walk to groceries, bottle shop, cafe and restaurants.\\n\\nParking is the only thing that is a bit awkward.  The listing description is accurate in this regard.  If you have a regular size car you will not be able to get into the driveway, which is such a shame.  We were able to get longer stay parking in other streets, but this obviously wasn't as convenient. It was doable though.\\n\\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay and intend to stay there again.\"},\n",

Myös Wi-Fi katkeili jatkuvasti, mutta olen tyytyväinen, että oli edes jonkinmoinen nettiyhteys. Miriamin yhteydenpito oli asiallista ja hyvää. Ohjeet avainten saamiseen tuli hyvissä ajoin ja olivat selkeät. Myös asunnossa oli selkeät ohjeet kaikkeen tarvittavaan. Kaiken kaikkiaan olemme erittäin tyytyväisiä tähän asuntoon ja majoittajaan. Suosittelen erittäin lämpimästi, 5 tähteä.'},\n",

       "    'comments': 'Miriam\\'s home was the perfect location for our family\\'s summer trip to Brooklyn.  Her home was well appointed with all the basic necessities one would need for cooking and relaxing when you needed a break from the city.  The apartment is on the most picturesque street of stunning brownstones and lovely old trees.  It it quiet and felt very safe and is conveniently located near many restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores and namely, the lovely Fort Greene park which we visited almost daily with our four young children.  Close to many subway lines, Miriam\\'s apartment was perfectly located for popping into Manhattan as well as getting around Brooklyn in general.  \\nCheck in was seamless, Miriam was the perfect balance of attentive and easy to get in touch with without feeling like you were being \"watched\".  The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed and was very comfortable.  We met many neighbors and my children played with some of the neighborhood children on several occasions and have even made a pen pal.  \\nThank you so much, we would love to stay there again in future travels.

Me and my family (me and my husband, two teenagers and a younger one) stayed there for a little bit more then 2 weeks and we just loved ut. The picture of the apartment really tell you the truth. It´s clean, wifi works well, the garden with the possibility for a BBQ is like a small rainforest in the middle av the city. Miriam is a really good host and easy to get in contact with if needed - for both questions and travel- och restaurant recommendations. Many different stations for metro in the surrounding makes travel easy and Fort Greene as a neighborhood is great and a good hub for exploring Williamsburg, Brooklyn Heights, Red Hook and other interesting parts of Brooklyn. Why don´t take a evening walk to Brooklyn bridge park or an a morning jog in Fort Green park just outside the door? We would absolutely consider to stay here again when we do our next trip to NYC.'},\n",

The apartment is nicely furnished with a large kitchen and even has an outdoor garden at the back.

It is located at mile 8 of the course.  Just about a 500 foot walk!  The apartment is located very close to subway into Manhattan and surrounding areas.  Plenty of good restaurants and convenience stores nearby.  Our favorite was the Green Grape & Provisions, for wine, craft beer and fresh soups, etc.  Miriam was so helpful in giving us her \"spot\" on the street for one car and we were very lucky to find a 2nd spot on the street for our 2nd car.  There are rules around times you can park, but we arrived on Friday afternoon and stayed until Tuesday with no problems at all. There are garages in the surrounding area that do have spots available for longer stays if needed. The apartment itself is clean and comfortable, although we did not spend much time there.  The master with bathroom was nice, and the 2nd bedroom in the basement was fine, but be sure to understand it is the basement with furnace in the room and slightly steep stairs.  Great towels and linens were also provided.  Miriam was a very good host!'},\n",

We were 7 and we had all the space, 2 bathrooms was a must and a large opened kitchen which was fully\\xa0equipped to spend good breakfast, lunch or dinner time. We didn’t have the opportunity to relax in the garden but it was charming and we believe that it must be so cool to have BBQ or jus rest. We discovered the neighborhood, just turn the quiet street the home is and you’ll get in Brooklyn, a slice of New York in a more relaxed atmosphere and authentic architecture. Nice restaurants, subways to go anywhere, groceries with fresh foods, it’s all around the corner. Few minutes from the apartment you can go to Barclays center and see NBA Brooklyn Nets, have shopping in Fulton & Jays streets, Fort Greene park  is a nice place, only 4 stations to reach Brooklyn Bridge and its unique view of Manhattan with the C train which is only 3 minutes from the apartment at walking distance,  Thanks to Miriam we had a wonderful stay in New York Brooklyn.'},\n",

       "  'neighborhood_overview': 'Poble Sec is located just next the mountain of Montjuic, not to be missed for its several museums (Miró Foundation, MNAC, Caixafòrum, Ethnological Museum, Archaeology Museum, etc.), the Olympic Ring, the Castle and the cableway, its wonderful views of Barcelona and for being a green escape to the bustle of the city (and to heat in summer). The area is very well supplied: supermarket right in front of the apartment, the best artisan bakery in the neighbourhood just next door, two butchers (one of them organic), fish shop, drugstore, banks and playground for children, all just within a 100 meters radius (more facilities a bit farther). The neighbourhood is a lively and trendy one, with plenty of cafés, bars, restaurants, theatres and concert halls to enjoy the city from breakfast to evening, either alone, in couple, with friends or with kids.',\n",

The apartment is in building with a common courtyard (common for the style). The other people that live in the building were very friendly and helpful answering any questions we had. My son was even able to play with the other children (despite the language barrier). Awesome experience -- would definietly rent again.'},\n",

The neighborhood is well situated - it is not at all touristy but close to transportation at Plaza España and Poble Sec metro stops so you can easily get to all the places you want to visit. We stayed here for 3 nights with our two children and found it perfect. We were able to walk or take the metro everywhere we wanted to go, but have a quieter place to sleep and relax. There is a park down the street and a supermarket directly across. Xavi met us on arrival and was very nice and helpful throughout our stay. When my husband accidentally left a few things in the apartment, Xavi collected them and met us upon our return to Barcelona a few days later to return them. Thanks, Xavi! It was a great stay in Barcelona and I would definitely recommend the apartment to anyone looking for space and comfort in a close but quieter neighborhood. '},\n",

The duplex was very nice and spacious, clean, charming, outfitted with everything we needed, with comfortable beds and a very nice kitchen (with an induction cooktop!).  The property is older and there was some remodeling noise for a few hours from the neighboring apartment, which we could hear through what seemed to be a shared skylight, but it was very brief and not a concern (unless noise privacy is a very high priority, which it wasn't for us).  We didn't even use the third bedroom with bunk beds, but it would be ideal for a family.  The metro was close enough, and the bakery just downstairs, together with the grocery store literally across the street, were a wonderful convenience.  We went nearly everywhere by metro, and the location was central enough that at the end of the day, if we were too tired to make our way back by metro, an easy cab ride back to the apartment never exceeded 8 euros (which would've been the cost of the metro for all four of us anyway).  Overall, the apartment was a nice, comfortable bargain for family travel - not the most modern, but charming and fully met our needs.\"},\n",

We couldn't have found a better place. Yamila let us into the apartment and answered any questions we had. The apartment is perfectly situated near a metro stop with easy access to anything you would want to see or do in Barcelona. There are great places to eat nearby and a small supemarket, pastry shop, butcher, fresh fish place, and a general store sort of place all on the same street. There are some great and friendly neighbors as well. There is a nice outdoor eating place off the kitchen. All the basics are covered and we were able to make meals in the apartment without any issues. Took us a minute to figure out the stovetop but after finding the instructions in English online we realized if it was blinking at us there wasn't enough weight and we needed to move the pot or pan to a smaller eye. We had a problem with the washing machine and called Xavi who was accommodating and over within an hour to check it out. He also collected the keys our last day and was as easy and wonderful to work with as Yamila. We even had some family members come visit in the extra bedroom, which did not have an AC unit but was fine with a fan - at least for the month of June when we were there. Having the second bathroom when we had guests was nice too. I would highly recommend this place for anyone. I appreciated that what you see is what you get. The pictures are exactly what you will see and have in the apartment. No surprises.\"},\n",

       "    'comments': \"Le logement est bien situé, dans un quartier paisible et agréable, à proximité des transports en commun et de tout. Ces points, importants, font en sorte que la location est acceptable. Cependant, les photos donnent une impression plus positive de l'appartement que la réalité; une des deux chambres manquent complètement d'intimité, ce qui pourrait être réglé en faisant transférant cette chambre dans une pièce quasi de rangement qui est inutilisée; l,appartement est vieillot, ce qui pourrait être acceptable, si des efforts étaient consentis pour remplacer tout ce qui est désuet et demande des réparations, somme toute, mineures: rideau de douche à quelques euros, changé de couleur et pas du tout invitant, cafetière à expresso qui a 100 ans...pleins de petits éléments brisés ou pas adéquats: lumière dans l,escalier, bout de plancher brisé, barure de porte brisée. Bref, il y a des limites à vouloir faire de l'argent: quelques centaines d'euros investis rendrait ce logement beaucoup plus acceptable. La dame qui nous a accueillie n'est pas en cause; elle est aimable et l'appartement avait été bien nettoyé, mais reste douteux quand les épouses refusent de prendre une douche parce que le rideau est blanc-brun...Finalement, je crois que AIRBNB n'est pas assez présent dans le rapport avec le locateur: il n'y a pas de standards suffisants pour garantir l'acceptabilité du service. Disons que c'était passable à acceptable, mais d'un point de vue affaire, le service peut être bien amélioré \"},\n",

Although it is a relatively small space it felt spacious for the five of us. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe entrance is through quite a dark courtyard and arriving late at night it did give us pause. But during the day you realize it's an inner courtyard accessed by several apartments, full mostly with families from what we could see.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kitchen had everything we needed for simple meals, the bathrooms worked perfectly, the little reading nook was a favorite space, and the air conditioning in the two primary bedrooms was appreciated as it was a hot week when we stayed. The middle room with the couch that turns into a bed didn't have air conditioning and it took some thinking to get air flowing through that space.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe liked the neighborhood as it feels like it is full of locals, not tourists. There are restaurants all around as well as markets and shops, making it very simple to keep everyone happy with food. The metro and bus stops are within a few blocks and very convenient. Both my sister and I used the bus to go to the airport (40 mins or so), though a taxi from the airport was only about 25 Euro.\\r\\n\\r\\nNoise does travel easily from apartment to apartment in the courtyard but I was impressed by how well everyone stuck to the quiet hours. From around 11 at night until around 10 in the morning there was very little noise. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would happily stay at Cristina's again, both for the comfort of the apartment and the authenticity of the neighborhood.\"},\n",

We tended to walk into the city, and catch the metro back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a small supermarket across the road, plus many local shops nearby including butchers, fishmongers, bakery and a 24-hour shop.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had no issues during our stay, but Yamila was easy to communicate with, and responded quickly to confirm our leaving plans. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe would fully recommend staying at Cristina’s house.\\r\\n'},\n",

       "    'comments': \"What a wonderful place!! My family and I (a group of 4) stayed here for a full week in June. At the time, Barcelona was having an unusual heat wave, so Cristina's place ended up being a true oasis for us! Poble Sec is a great neighborhood and allows for easy access to many of the main attractions in Barcelona. We would regularly walk a couple short blocks to the main road, Paral Lel, and easily catch a taxi to the beach or to Oldtown for sightseeing etc. It's possible to walk to many sights, but during the heat wave we had to rely on rides!\\nThe house itself was lovely, fully equipped kitchen, two bathrooms and a very comfortable living room. The downstairs patio magically stays cooler than anywhere else outside so we sat there often. Everything was clean and easy to use!\\nThere is a wonderful bakery next door that we went to every morning. Two great plazas in either direction a block away for coffees, sandwiches, tapas and drinks. And, there is a market directly across the street so you always have access to necessities. Carrer Blai is a lively street very close by that is buzzing at night with great people watching. This is a fantastic place for pinxtos, with every option you can imagine. This is a great street for lounging with drinks in outdoor seating and seems to be filled with locals and tourists alike.\\nCristina was fast with communication and gave lots of information about the house and area. Yamilla helped us check in and out, and was so kind and helpful!! We loved our stay and absolutely recommend staying here while you are in Barcelona!!\"},\n",

       "    'comments': ' Of the three cities we visited on our family trip Europe - BCN was the absolute best and this amazing apt. in Pablo-Sec helped make our experience perfect.  Our host was a total delight - really good at her job!  She met us at the exact appointed times, and I knew that I could count on her if anything went awry.  She was great at providing us with so many useful details about the area and for giving me all the instructions that I needed to cook and do laundry. (I guess I can\\'t get away from that - even on vacation!!!)  \\nThe house was super comfortable for me, my husband, and our two teen boys. It was also VERY clean and tidy.  Everyone had their own space - which was a welcome departure from what we experienced in London and Paris.   We did rely on the air conditioning at night. It was pretty hot for us - as we come from Oregon and are not so used to it!  We made good use of the patio, that\\'s for sure!  (Actually, there are three outdoor patios in this home, but the one on the bottom floor, off the kitchen, got the most use by us.)  \\nThe baths were great - just fine.  We are a very tall family (all the men are over 6\\'5\") so it was good to use a shower that they could stand up in!  \\nThe kitchen was really great to use and provided everything we needed!  I was so grateful for how thoughtfully everything was provided to us as guests.  \\nThe location is ideal - it\\'s just two blocks from the Metro and the neighborhood has all the shops you need for local shopping - a bakery, a butcher, a Super Mercado and tons of cafes.  It\\'s not a touristy location at all - which we loved.   My boys went down to the beach almost every day we were there - to swim, drink beer (and look at the awesome women !!) and my husband and I explored the beautiful streets and art and culture of Barcelona - all within easy reach.  \\nWe hope to come back!  We would love to book again and certainly recommend this very nice Pablo-sec apt to friends and family... and anyone reading this review!\\nDenise Slattery and Steve Michener\\nLake Oswego, Oregon\\n'},\n",

For those arriving in Barcelona by car, near the apartment (3 minuts by walk) there is a municipal parking named \"Aparcament Municipal Rius and Taulet\". With special rates for 3/5/7 days, during this time you have the opportunity to use the same ticket to park the car in several municipal parking located around the city and close to several turistic attractions: Sagrada Familia, Parc Guell, Barceloneta, etc... Barcelona is great! like its people! Last but not least, Cristina and her assistants are perfect hosts. They are always fast to reply at your  questions and very helpful.

Aussi une boulangerie, un marchand de fruits et légumes.\\n-l'organisation arrivée/départ est parfaitement bien rodée , nous remercions Javier pour son extrême gentillesse et sa grande disponibilité! \\nAucun défaut, allez-y les yeux fermés ! Barcelone est une ville dynamique, culturelle, festive et les barcelonais sont tous très accueillants et ont le sens du service !\\nQuel dommage d'avoir du repartir ce matin...\"},\n",
